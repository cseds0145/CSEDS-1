   <center><h1><b>Reasons OF Global Warming</h1></center>
    <pGlobal warming is primarily caused by human activities that increase the concentration of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to a rise in Earth's average temperature. The main driver is the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas) for energy and transportation, but other significant contributors include deforestation, industrial processes, and agriculture>
    <h2>1. Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h2>
    <p>The burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation is the largest single source of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

    <h2>2. Deforestation</h2>
    <p>Forests absorb carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. When trees are cut down for timber or to make way for agriculture, this stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere.</p>

    <h2>3. Industrial Processes</h2>
    <p>Certain industrial processes emit greenhouse gases as a byproduct. For example, cement production releases carbon dioxide when limestone is heated.</p>

    <h2>4. Agriculture</h2>
    <p>Agricultural practices, including livestock production and rice cultivation, produce significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.</p>

    <h2>5. Waste Management</h2>
    <p>Landfills produce methane as organic waste decomposes. Poor waste management practices can exacerbate this issue.</p>
